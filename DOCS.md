## 1 - MVP of a virtual movie store
This project is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a virtual movie store, designed to provide core functionality for browsing and purchasing movies online with a focus on simplicity and validation.

## 2 - Will be applied: functional interface based on prototype using Vue, VueX, SCSS (CSS-scoped)
- **Vue.js**: Framework for building the interactive user interface.
- **VueX**: State management to handle global data like movie catalog and cart.
- **SCSS (CSS-scoped)**: Styled with SCSS using Vue's native `<style scoped>` for modular and scoped CSS.
- **Basic usability**: Focus on simple navigation, search, and cart functionality for a user-friendly experience.

## 3 - Will be applied Clean Code and MVVM
- **Clean Code**: Adhering to naming conventions, readability, and simplicity standards.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**:
  - **Model** in state management (Vuex).
  - **View** in Vue components and views.
  - **ViewModel** in composables (used to decouple logic from the view).

## 4 - API Used
- **Public API**: https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started will be used to fetch movie data.

## 5 - Serverless deployment using Vercel free
The application will be deployed using Vercel's free tier, leveraging serverless architecture for automatic scaling and hosting.
